This paper develops SteinerSQL, a novel three-stage framework that reformulates complex mathematical Text-to-SQL generation as a unified graph optimization problem. The work addresses the dual challenge of multi-step computation decomposition and intricate database schema navigation, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 36.10% execution accuracy on LogicCat and 36.75% on Spider2.0-Lite.
