This paper introduces MindVote, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ability to predict human opinions within naturalistic social discourse. The work addresses critical limitations of existing sanitized survey-based evaluation methods and reveals substantial performance gaps and systematic biases invisible to traditional benchmarks, including domain-specific knowledge limitations, source of origin bias, and social media context dependencies.
