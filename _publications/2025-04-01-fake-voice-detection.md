This paper investigates the evolving threat landscape targeting voice-based systems, identifying potential misuse scenarios of fake voice generation about advanced TTS and voice conversion technologies. We benchmark the resilience of 20+ fake voice generators and 8 fake voice detectors to investigate the interaction and threats between fake voice generation and detection.
