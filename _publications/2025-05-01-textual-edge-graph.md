This paper presents a graph-aware LLM aggregator that captures higher-order context through line-graph views, enabling the generation of coherent, personalized reviews that are more helpful, authentic, and specific. Comprehensive evaluations on Amazon and Goodreads benchmarks demonstrate superior performance over numeric, graph-based, and LLM baselines in both recommendation quality and review generation.
