Xutao (Henry) Mao

Welcome! I am Xutao (Henry) Mao, a Computer Science student at Vanderbilt University with a strong focus on artificial intelligence and machine learning. I maintain a 3.867/4.0 GPA and have been consistently recognized on the Dean's List for all semesters (Fall 2022-Spring 2025). My academic journey has been enriched by the Vanderbilt University Summer Research Scholarship (2025), reflecting my commitment to excellence in both coursework and research.

Research Interests
My research interests primarily focus on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, including:

Trustworthy AI: Investigating fake voice generation and detection systems, developing comprehensive benchmarks to evaluate the resilience of voice-based security systems and understanding the evolving threat landscape in voice authentication.
Natural Language Processing: Working on personalization imputation for textual edge graphs, developing graph-aware LLM aggregators that capture higher-order context for generating coherent, personalized content.
Social Media Analysis: Creating comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' ability to predict human opinions within naturalistic social discourse, addressing critical limitations of existing evaluation methods.
Database Systems: Developing novel frameworks for complex Text-to-SQL generation, reformulating mathematical problems as unified graph optimization challenges.
