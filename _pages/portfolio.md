## Research Projects

### MindVote: Social Media Opinion Prediction
**June 2025**  
A comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ability to predict human opinions within naturalistic social discourse. This project addresses critical limitations of existing sanitized survey-based evaluation methods and reveals substantial performance gaps and systematic biases invisible to traditional benchmarks.

**Key Contributions:**
- Developed MindVote benchmark with comprehensive evaluation metrics
- Identified domain-specific knowledge limitations and source of origin bias
- Enabled authentic assessment of LLM social reasoning capabilities

### Fake Voice Detection Research
**September 2023 - May 2025**  
Investigated the evolving threat landscape targeting voice-based systems, identifying potential misuse scenarios of fake voice generation about advanced TTS and voice conversion technologies.

**Key Contributions:**
- Benchmarked resilience of 20+ fake voice generators and 8 fake voice detectors
- Analyzed interaction and threats between fake voice generation and detection
- Developed comprehensive security evaluation framework

### Textual Edge Graph Personalization
**October 2024 - July 2025**  
Designed and implemented a graph-aware LLM aggregator that captures higher-order context through line-graph views, enabling the generation of coherent, personalized reviews.

**Key Contributions:**
- Developed graph-aware LLM aggregator with higher-order context capture
- Achieved superior performance on Amazon and Goodreads benchmarks
- Improved recommendation quality and review generation authenticity

### SteinerSQL: Graph-Guided SQL Generation
**June 2025 - August 2025**  
Developed SteinerSQL, a novel three-stage framework that reformulates complex mathematical Text-to-SQL generation as a unified graph optimization problem.

**Key Contributions:**
- Created three-stage framework for complex SQL generation
- Achieved state-of-the-art performance: 36.10% on LogicCat, 36.75% on Spider2.0-Lite
- Addressed multi-step computation decomposition challenges
